```

Round-trip principle: `the model only emits tool_use; the local harness owns permissions, parallelism, side effects, compaction, memory, and UI.`

## Decisions

### D1. Messages API client: hand-rolled (reqwest + SSE)

- Anthropic still ships no official Rust SDK (confirmed: `claude-agent-sdk-rust` returns 404); every community SDK on crates.io is unmaintained or toy-grade.
- Hand-rolled scope: SSE event parsing (accumulate `input_json_delta` until `content_block_stop`, then parse), stop_reason, exponential-backoff retries (429/529, honoring retry-after, capped at 2-3 attempts).
- 2026 API status: prompt caching is GA (top-level `cache_control`, no beta header needed); thinking is configured via `adaptive` (interleaved applies automatically); thinking blocks must be returned verbatim, including the signature.

### D2. Tool protocol: trait + schemars, permissions as a separate gate

- The Zod equivalent: `schemars` generates inputSchema (`schema_for::<T>()`, single source of truth for the input struct; model-returned params are validated by serde deserialization, and errors are fed back to the model via is_error. No jsonschema validator is introduced — nine static, simple schemas gain nothing, and serde already covers type errors).
- Tools use a trait (name/aliases + inputSchema + call + isConcurrencySafe + isReadOnly/isDestructive + validateInput + interruptBehavior), defaulting to fail-closed (not concurrency-safe, allow).
- `checkPermissions` stays out of the trait — permissions are cross-cutting and go through a unified permission gate (cf. goose 2026: tool registration via the rmcp model, permissions behind a separate `Permission` gate).

### D3. MCP: rmcp (the official rust-sdk)

- `modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk`, official, 3.1.0 (2026-07-31). Client capabilities: **stdio** (TokioChildProcess) + **streamable HTTP** (`transport-streamable-http-client-reqwest`; rmcp 3.1 pins reqwest 0.13, so bingo's reqwest moves to 0.13 to unify the stack); OAuth exists as an SDK capability but is not enabled (static `headers` cover common auth).
- mcpServers config → connect → list_tools → adapt into the same Tool trait (isMcp + mcpInfo).
- Don't touch other MCP crates (mcp-server / mcplease have no client or are rudimentary).

### D4. TUI: iocraft (declarative components)

- `iocraft` 0.8.4 (declarative hooks + flexbox + fullscreen render loop); the component architecture is isomorphic to ink; `rsmarkdown-core` (streaming markdown parsing) is kept for AST → line rendering.
- bingo only wires components: the Chat component consumes stream events, the permission card consumes canUseTool, Task → tasks, Agent tool → agents.

### D5. Runtime and processes

- Single tokio runtime; crossterm EventStream + `tokio::select!` event loop; tool execution via JoinHandle/AbortHandle; input interruption = select + watch channel.
- Bash tool: `tokio::process` + `/bin/zsh -c` (same no-pty approach as goose; shlex unused); an interactive shell would come later with `portable-pty`.

### D6. Token counting: official count_tokens API

- Claude's tokenizer is closed-source; `claude-tokenizer` is unmaintained and inaccurate.
- Budget display goes through `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens`; local estimation falls back to `claude-tokenizer` but is never treated as authoritative.

### D7. Main loop semantics

- `stop_reason === 'tool_use'` is unreliable; go by the tool_use blocks actually present.
- Concurrent execution queue: safe tools run in parallel (cap 10); non-safe tools run serially and never overtake an unfinished write.

### D8. CLI entry: clap + explicit startup chain

- Argument parsing with `clap` (derive).
- Startup chain: `--version`/`--help` fast path (no heavy module loading) → env sanitization → settings pre-read → MCP connect → branch to interactive (TUI) or headless (`--print`/`-p`).
- Initial CLI surface: `--model`, `--permission-mode`, `--continue`, `--add-dir`, `-p/--print` (headless).

### D9. Config layering: settings.json + feature flags

- Config layers: user (`~/.config/bingo/settings.json`) / project (`.bingo/settings.json`) / local (`.bingo/local.json`), shallow-merged; local is never committed.
- settings carries: permissionMode, hooks config, mcpServers, theme/notification preferences.
- Feature flags: compile-time `feature()` (the bundle DCE equivalent) + runtime switches; new capabilities default off. No GrowthBook — a local CLI doesn't need remote rollout.

### D10. System prompt assembly + prompt caching strategy

- The system prompt is assembled in segments: base (role/rules) → tool description → CLAUDE.md memory layer (managed/user/project/--add-dir) → session extras.
- The segment order is the caching strategy: cache tools → system in order (`cache_control: ephemeral` placed at the tail breakpoints of system and messages, minimum cache size 512~4096 tokens), guaranteeing that only the tail changes across turns.

### D11. Transcript and session storage

- A transcript (JSON Lines) is persisted per session; `--continue`/`--resume` resumes from it.
- Compact is bounded by the transcript: archive before compacting, then replace with a generated summary segment.

### D12. Token budget management

- Output side: dynamic max_tokens management (upgrade path) and a per-turn output budget (continuation on overflow).
- Input side: token counting via D6; hitting a threshold triggers autoCompact.

### D13. Sandbox and telemetry: explicitly out of scope (initially)

- No sandbox — the permission gate + modes are the security boundary; logged as a future item.
- No telemetry — only local debug logging. Avoid an analytics dependency.

### D14. Multi-agent boundary

- Phase one only covers subagents (the Agent tool recursing into queryLoop; subagents keep their own message history).
- No worktree/teammate/team-collaboration surface (product surface, not core harness); add later as needed.

### D15. Task tracking: v2 Task tool family

- **Tool surface**: `TaskCreate` (subject/description/activeForm?/metadata?, one task per call, returns `{task:{id,subject}}`), `TaskUpdate` (taskId + optional fields, **incremental patch semantics**; status gains `deleted` for permanent removal that also cleans up references from other tasks), `TaskGet`, `TaskList` (filters `metadata._internal`, completed tasks excluded from blockedBy). Shared attributes: shouldDefer, no permission check, renderToolUseMessage null (UI goes through the task area), expanding the task area when a tool is called.
- **Storage**: on disk at `~/.local/share/bingo/tasks/<listId>/<taskId>.json`, one file per task, **persisted across sessions**; numeric ids increment (max+1); fault-tolerant per-entry parsing on read; in-process mutual exclusion (bingo is single-process; no cross-process concurrency).
- **Input repair layer**: repairs near-miss key names (title/name→subject, content→description, active_form→activeForm, unwraps a task wrapper, backfills a missing description); misuse (tasks/todos array params, Agent params) returns guidance text.
- **Hooks**: new `TaskCreated` / `TaskCompleted` events; TaskCompleted's blockingError can **reject** the completed status.
- **Reminder injection**: a `task_reminder` message with thresholds `TURNS_SINCE_WRITE=10` / `TURNS_BETWEEN_REMINDERS=10`; injected when the tool list contains TaskUpdate; injected as a meta user message + "NEVER mention this reminder".
- **What bingo borrows**: v2's incremental semantics (v1's full-list overwrite is a lost-update breeding ground under concurrency) + disk persistence + a single-file lock (same shape as the transcript file convention); **drops** owner/swarm assignment (D14 ruled out teammate) and metadata merge (v1 support is enough); the TaskCompleted blocking hook aligns with existing hook semantics; reminder thresholds taken as-is: 10/10.

## Implementation checklist (in implementation order)

1. Minimal headless loop: API client + queryLoop + Read/Bash tools + permission gate (D1/D2/D7/D8)
2. Concurrent queue + Hooks runtime (shell hook, JSON stdin/stdout)
3. System prompt assembly + transcript storage + token budget (D10/D11/D12)
4. MCP integration (rmcp → Tool adaptation)
5. TUI wiring (iocraft) + slash commands
6. Compact + CLAUDE.md/memdir memory + subagents (Agent tool)
7. Later: sandbox, plugins, worktree/teammate (deferred items from D13/D14)

## Decisions (continued)

### D16. TUI rendering layer: iocraft declarative components (migrated from the ratatui family)

- **Rationale**: declarative components (hooks + flexbox + fullscreen render loop) are the efficient shape for terminal UI; after the migration, bingo's UI architecture is isomorphic to mainstream agent TUIs, so layouts can be matched 1:1 against the reference implementation.
- **Trade-offs**: `rsmarkdown-tui` (the App/Component framework, ~12k lines) is dropped entirely; `rsmarkdown-core` (streaming markdown parsing, display-independent) is kept. The whole rendering layer is rewritten as iocraft elements (no ratatui Line adapter bridge kept).
- **New structure**: `src/tui/` — `chat.rs` (state machine + document row building; event semantics and collapse logic kept as-is), `line.rs` (styled line model), `theme.rs` (dark tokens), `markdown.rs` (AST → lines; ported from renderer.rs), `activities.rs` (activity data + ported header/collapse layouts), `components.rs` (iocraft root component + transcript).
- **Layout reference points**: single-column layout (no sidebar) = sticky header + scrollable transcript + task list + notification line + input line + `╰──╯` border + 1-line footer; permission requests render at the bottom of the transcript (non-modal); message blocks marginTop=1; footer left = mode badge (⏸ plan / ⏵⏵ accept edits) + shortcut byline, right = model name.
- **Key pitfall (verified)**: iocraft `State::write()` marks dirty on every deref → an unconditional write() in the component body causes infinite re-render (observable in the mock terminal as ~350 frames/sec of idle spinning). Writes must be "guarded": write only when the layout size or the document is dirty; dirty is set by event/tick consumers.
- **Interaction parity**: mouse-click collapse/expand (local coords from `use_local_terminal_events` → doc line numbers), wheel, ctrl+o global expand, j/k/G/g/PageUp/Down scrolling, Esc/Ctrl+C interrupt while busy, numeric-key selection for permissions. Tested through the dual channels `mock_terminal_render_loop` + line-level `build_rows`.

### D17. TUI rendering fixes: diff residue and small-window misalignment (verified on iocraft 0.8.4)

- **Symptoms**: ghosting/duplicate lines on real terminals — after a "stuck" thinking running-state, the next line re-renders; the input line `❯ ▋` leaves residue in several places; short and long versions of a long reply body coexist; worse when the window shrinks.
- **Root causes (three verified chains)**:
  1. iocraft's fullscreen line diff (`write_canvas`: per-line MoveTo + rewrite) leaves stale lines when **line numbers shift** (markdown wrap line counts change, messages added/removed, sticky appears) — the write sequence itself is correct (verified by per-frame decode), but the terminal state drifts from the in-memory prev.
  2. `use_terminal_size` depends on Resize events; when events are lost/delayed, the canvas height mismatches the real terminal (tmux winsize lag: pane at 16 lines while bingo reads 24) → MoveTo out of bounds → the terminal scrolls → misalignment.
  3. The sticky header occupies 1 layout row → content shifts as a whole when it appears/disappears.
- **Fixes (bingo side; iocraft untouched)**:
  1. Sticky becomes an **absolutely-positioned overlay** (no layout space; `Position::Absolute` inside Transcript).
  2. **Set the `FORCE_FULL_REDRAW` global flag when the doc line count changes or on TurnEnd**; a custom hook (`use_force_redraw_on_resize`) consumes it in `post_component_update` → `updater.clear_terminal_output()` forces a full-screen clear + redraw (bypassing the line diff).
  3. Poll terminal size (the hook's poll_change reads crossterm size) → size changes also trigger a full clear.
- **Verification**: real-API (DeepSeek) tmux multi-turn conversations — streaming bodies, tool rounds, and thinking blocks interleaved, small-window (16 lines) resize round-trips; no ghosting anywhere. Mock regression: all 171 tests green.

### D18. Theme configuration (the `theme` setting)

- **Config**: `settings.json` gains `"theme": "auto" | "dark" | "light"` (default auto).
- **auto detection**: before fullscreen, briefly enter raw mode and send OSC 11 to query the terminal's real background color (`ESC ] 11 ; ? ESC \`), then judge light/dark by BT.709 relative luminance; next, the `$COLORFGBG` seed; if neither, fall back to dark. Pitfall: OSC replies carry no newline and canonical-mode line buffering swallows them — must read in raw mode.
- **Tokens**: two semantic token sets for dark/light (light body text black `rgb(0,0,0)`, `userMessageBackground` 240, primary accent orange identical in both themes). When truecolor is unsupported, RGB degrades to 256 colors (AnsiValue cube approximation).
- **Welcome title**: `Welcome back` uses the primary accent orange, not white.

### D19. Streaming ghosting root fix: event-level forced full clear (diff-path residue)

- **Symptom (user's real terminal Ghostty; not reproducible in tmux)**: as streaming text grows, "half-covered" rows appear — new content covers part of an old line while old characters linger at the end; a TurnEnd full clear restores it.
- **Investigation**: trace confirms the FORCE full-clear path itself is correct (after every doc line-count change the hook consumes it and rewrites everything, 0 mismatches); not reproducible in tmux/pty/simulated terminals → the problem is the **diff path**: when content grows within a line (line count unchanged), iocraft's line diff runs and stale lines remain on real terminals. DeepWiki consultation: `write_ansi_row_without_newline` should in theory always clear the line tail, but row_eq's trimmed comparison can falsely judge equality with background colors/fill (issue #142 family).
- **Fix**: **any event handling (`drain_all` returns true, covering TextDelta/ThinkingDelta/ToolStart etc.) immediately sets `FORCE_FULL_REDRAW`** → every frame with content changes goes through a full clear + redraw, bypassing the line diff. Atomic within one frame under synchronized update (2026), so no flicker; DeepWiki confirms this pattern is idiomatic iocraft (same as inside `use_output`).

### D20. Default interaction switches to REPL inline mode (non-fullscreen, iocraft use_output)

- **Background**: the previous default fullscreen iocraft canvas (alt screen + in-app viewport scrolling + input pinned to the bottom) was perceived by users as a "big app shell that forces repainting"; the reference implementation's default (in the user's environment) is non-fullscreen: settled content lands in scrollback like ordinary terminal output, the wheel scrolls history, and the prompt sits at the end of the conversation rather than pinned to the bottom.
- **Mechanism**: non-fullscreen = print-and-forget (settled messages render once to stdout, never rewritten) + a dynamic tail (streaming/spinner/input lines) redrawn in place (relative to the cursor line diff); lines scrolled out of the viewport freeze, avoiding full redraws.
- **Selection**: first, a hand-written REPL driver (ANSI serialization + rollback/flush bookkeeping + self-managed crossterm event loop, ~500 lines, kept recoverable in `git stash`) to validate the mechanism; then confirmed **iocraft 0.8.4's native `use_output` is the equivalent** (`hooks/use_output.rs:74` exec: `clear_terminal_output` → write to stdout → render loop repaints) → dropped the hand-written driver and reused at the component layer (markdown/theme/activity layout/`row_element` + `to_string()` offscreen rendering).
- **Implementation**: the `Bingo` component gains an `inline` mode — as `doc.settled` (the settlement boundary; the mechanism predates D19) advances, flush each row via `println(row_element(row).to_string())` (multi-line blocks must be flushed line by line: with raw mode's OPOST off, an in-block `\n` doesn't return to column zero, causing staircase misalignment — demonstrated by the rsink demo); the Transcript renders the tail slice `rows[tail_start..]` (flush boundary = max(printed, settled, len−max_live); canvas height always ≤ the terminal; inline erasing never pollutes scrollback); key gate: idle Esc ignored / ctrl+o only passes unsettled messages / idle Ctrl+C → `system.exit()` (requires `ignore_ctrl_c()` so the event reaches the component; while busy, Ctrl+C cancels via on_key); `--fullscreen` keeps the original canvas path.
- **Incidental fix**: `detect_system_theme` used `tokio::fs` to read `/dev/tty` — after a timeout the blocking thread's read() is uncancellable, swallowing the next first input and hanging tokio's shutdown join (the process can't exit); switched to `std::fs` + `O_NONBLOCK` + polling (libc dependency, already locked).
- **Verification**: PTY smoke tests (python pty + winsize 100x24): welcome card flushed, no alt screen, input reflected key by key, thinking spinner redrawn in the dynamic area with rollback, Ctrl+C exit stable 6/6; all 178 tests pass.

### D20b. Two inline-mode fixes (startup clear + input pinned to bottom)

- **Startup clear**: `ForceRedrawOnResize`'s first detection (treating `last=None` as a size change) + a first-frame `FORCE_FULL_REDRAW` (doc line count 0→N) → the first frame calls `clear_terminal_output()` to clear leftover shell output. Fix: the first poll only records the baseline size without counting as a change; `post_component_update` skips the clear on the first frame (the `first` flag). Fullscreen mode is unaffected (entering the alt screen is already blank).
- **Input pinned to bottom**: the inline root View had a fixed `height: height` (fullscreen design) → the canvas always fills the terminal and the input line is pinned to the last screen row. Fix: the inline root View has no fixed height (natural content height) and the Transcript gets `flex_grow: 0` — canvas height = tail + chrome's actual row count (3 rows when idle), and the input line flows with the content, consistent with non-fullscreen.
- Verification (PTY + winsize 100x24): no Clear-All/clear sequence at startup; after input, the redraw rolls back by 2 (canvas height 3, previously 23); Ctrl+C exits in ~0.3s.

### D20c. Double newline on flush fixed (println + trailing \n from to_string)

- **Symptom**: one conversation, two formats — the dynamic area is compact (`Mulling for 1.4s …` lines with no blank lines between), but after flushing, extra blank lines appear between rows (looser line spacing in scrollback).
- **Root cause**: the ANSI string from `ElementExt::to_string()` always ends with `\n` (iocraft canvas Display; tests assert `"hello!\n"`); `StdoutHandle::println` then adds `\r\n` → every flushed row becomes `line\n\r\n`, rendered on screen as "line + blank line".
- **Fix**: `trim_end_matches(['\n', '\r'])` before flushing via println. PTY verification: flush sequence `❯ hello` → margin blank line → next message; no interleaved blank lines.
- **Side investigation (not fixed; pre-existing behavior)**: Ctrl+C cancel while busy — the `client.stream()` connect/stream-setup phase isn't inside `select!` (query.rs:234 awaits before the select), so cancellation can't interrupt a hanging connection (e.g. a local discard port); irrelevant under real API streaming.

### D20d. Flushed color loss fixed (to_string without ANSI)

- **Symptom**: after the D20c double-newline fix, everything flushed to scrollback is colorless (the dynamic area is fine).
- **Root cause**: `Canvas::write()` ("as unstyled text, without ANSI escape codes" — the unstyled path) is the `Display` implementation; `ElementExt::to_string()` = `render(None).to_string()` goes through Display → **every flushed row is plain text**. `write_ansi()` (pub) is the color-carrying output path.
- **Fix**: flushing becomes `row_element(...).render(None).write_ansi(&mut buf)` + trim the trailing `\r\n` before println. PTY verification: flushed bytes contain truecolor/256-color codes.

### D20e. Resize viewport redraw (fullReset / OffscreenFreeze semantics)

- **Symptom**: styling breaks after a window resize — flushed rows keep their old-width wrapping, and the dynamic area misaligns after reflow.
- **Semantics verified** (key point raised by the user): **content inside the viewport is not Static** — it only freezes after scrolling out of the viewport; message re-rendering depends on resize; resize takes the fullReset path: clearTerminal + full rewrite at the new width (including the accumulated in-memory fullStaticOutput).
- **Implementation**: on inline-mode size changes (last_size detection, first frame excepted) → set `chat.dirty` (forcing the doc to rebuild at the new width — without this, dirty isn't set when no tick has run and replay would use the old-width doc) → set the replay flag → during flush: `\x1b[2J\x1b[H` (clear the visible area + home) + redraw the "flushed rows inside the viewport" at the new width (`rows[printed-N..printed]`, N ≈ screen height − dynamic area height; scrollback outside the viewport stays untouched); printed isn't double-counted.
- **Related**: `reply_cache` (markdown render cache) doesn't distinguish widths → clear it on width changes (tracked via `prev_build_width`), otherwise message text keeps old-width wrapping.
- **Pitfall**: the first version forced build_rows via `width_changed`, which stalled the mock render loop (frame scheduling broken); switched to "size change → set dirty" to take the normal rebuild path.
- Verification: all 178 tests pass; PTY resize 100→60: exactly one 2J, replayed rows wrap at 60 (welcome narrow-column text overflow and non-wrapping user messages are pre-existing layout behaviors).

### D20f. Panic on rapid resize (flush cursor out of bounds)

- **Symptom**: during rapid resizes, `thread 'main' panicked at components.rs: range end index 28 out of range for slice of length 26`.
- **Root cause**: width changes on resize → after `build_rows` reflows, `doc.rows` shrinks (narrower widths wrap less), but the flush cursor `printed` still holds the old value (> the new `doc.rows.len()`); the flush slice `rows[*p..live_start]` and the replay slice `rows[*p-replay_n..*p]` go out of bounds. `live_start = max(printed, ...)` also relies on the un-clamped printed.
- **Fix**: at the start of the inline branch (**before** computing `live_start`), clamp the flush cursor `*p = min(*p, doc.rows.len())` — all slices become safe again.
- Verification: 25 rapid width switches (40-120) × 5 rounds with messages sent in between; no panics; all 178 tests pass.

### D20g. Real input cursor (layout equivalent, since iocraft has no cursor API)

- **Requirement**: while typing, the terminal's real cursor should rest after the input text (reference experience) instead of a fake `▋` cursor "floating at the end".
- **Mechanism**: after the render loop outputs, move the real cursor to the position the component declares (the input's cursorOffset); it only freezes outside the viewport.
- **iocraft 0.8.4 has no such API** (after rendering, the cursor always rests at the end of the canvas's last line; TextInput also uses a fake cursor — an absolutely positioned color block). Equivalent implementation: **make the input line the canvas's last line** — after iocraft renders, the real cursor naturally rests at the end of the input text. Inline chrome order adjusted: tasks/warn/waiting/footer/top border/**input line (last)**; the `▋` fake cursor is removed from the input line. Fullscreen keeps the original layout (the `▋` fake cursor).
- **Side investigation (not fixed; environment-specific)**: in the pty test environment, keyboard events occasionally don't arrive — iocraft's `Terminal::new` synchronously calls `crossterm::supports_keyboard_enhancement()` (sends `\x1b[?u` etc., ~2.5s timeout), and in a non-responding pty the probe can swallow input during that window; the HEAD baseline (fullscreen) reproduces it too → not introduced by this change; real terminals respond and are unaffected (typing works normally).

### D20h. Input returns to a full box; the real-cursor approach is rejected

- **Symptom**: the D20g "input line last" layout (no bottom border, footer moved up) was rejected by the user — "the input box is wrong and I can't type".
- **Postmortem**: in the user's screenshot, text was visible after ❯ (typing actually worked) — "can't type" was really a cursor-perception problem: once D20g removed the `▋` fake cursor, iocraft's rendered real cursor rested on the canvas's last line (not following the input), so users couldn't see where they were typing. Real-cursor tracking (ink frame.cursor) is unimplementable in iocraft 0.8.4 (no component-declared cursor API).
- **Fix**: restore the full input box (top border + `❯ {input}▋` + bottom border + footer below); inline mode emits `\x1b[?25l` to hide the real terminal cursor (so the footer's real cursor doesn't get confused with `▋`); iocraft automatically Shows it on exit. Verification: top/bottom borders, `▋`, and the cursor-hide sequence are all present; all 178 tests pass.

### D20i. Total event blackout root cause: render storm from writing State during render (clamp writes every frame)

- **Symptom**: on real terminals (reproduced by the user and in tmux), typing/Ctrl+C/resize all stop working; in the pty environment, startup output balloons to 122KB (full redraw every frame).
- **Root cause**: D20f's flush-cursor clamp `*p = (*p).min(doc.rows.len())` runs **every frame** — iocraft's `State::write` (DerefMut) **unconditionally** marks `did_change` and calls `waker.wake()` (use_state.rs:149-163, even when the value is unchanged) — writing state **during render → wake → immediate re-render** → render storm → in the render loop's `select(root.wait(), term.wait())`, `root.wait()` is always ready → **`term.wait()` starves → terminal events (keyboard/resize) never arrive**. Ctrl+C exit and resize replay (which depend on Resize events triggering replay) die with it — the user's "resize stopped working" is the same root cause.
- **Fix**: the clamp writes only when the value changes (`if clamped != *p { *p = clamped; }`). Audited every render-time state write: flush/replay/cursor_hidden/last_size all have conditional guards; only the clamp was missing one.
- **Verification** (real tmux terminal; the probe responds, so it fully reproduces): typing `❯ zz▋` ✓; Ctrl+C exit (pgrep 0) ✓; resize 100→60 viewport replay (welcome reflowed at width 60) ✓. All 178 tests pass.

### D21. The `!` command (bash mode)

- **Input side**: pressing `!` with an empty input enters shell mode (the `!` itself isn't inserted); in bash mode, backspace on an empty input exits; with non-empty input, `!` inserts normally. The mode is **sticky** (kept after submission). UI: input prefix `!` + the input box border switches to the `bashBorder` color; the footer shows `! for shell mode`.
- **Execution side**: **bypasses the model and the UserPromptSubmit hooks** — the command runs through the unified permission gate (PreToolUse hook + canUseTool + user confirmation) + the Bash tool + the PostToolUse hook; the UI reuses the existing tool activity rows (ToolUseStart/ToolReady/ToolDone). History is written in the shape of a real tool round (`<bash-input>` user text → synthesized assistant ToolUse → user ToolResult — **the API requires tool_result to pair with a tool_use in the same request**), and the output is HTML-escaped (`& < >`) and wrapped in `<bash-stdout>`.
- **Model response** (`respondToBashCommands`, same-named settings key, default true): true → after execution, enter queryLoop as usual (the model sees the output and may continue); false → execute only, and inject a caveat before the history (`<local-command-caveat>` "DO NOT respond to these messages…") so the model doesn't treat the output as instructions. Interruptions/PostToolUse blocks also take the "don't consult the model + caveat" path.
- **Implementation points**: `run_query` splits out `query_loop` (loop body) + `tool_context`, shared by `run_bash_command` and `run_query`; the TUI `Chat` gains a `bash_mode` state and `start_bash_turn`.
- **Trade-off**: stdout/stderr are no longer separated (dual tags) — bingo's Bash tool already merges output and includes the `$ cmd` echo and exit code, so the model loses no information; periodic/background commands (`!watch …`) directly reuse the tool's backgrounding semantics. Permission denials are also fed back to the model (consistent with run_query's `<permission_error>` convention; failures also consult the model).
- **Verification**: all 184 tests pass (new: `!` toggling, bash submission finalization, execution message shape and escaping, component rendering of prefix/border/hint, settings merging); PTY smoke: `!` prefix + `! for shell mode` hint + `!echo hello` executes directly (`✓ Bash $ echo hello · 9ms … +3 lines`) and stays in bash mode afterward.

### D21b. Interactive/TTY command rejection (shared by `!` and the Bash tool)

- **Motivation**: bingo's child processes have piped stdin/stdout but **inherit the controlling terminal** — fullscreen TUIs (top/htop/vim) print garbage, ssh/fzf/sudo reaching straight for `/dev/tty` seize the terminal (the screen gets torn apart in raw mode), and bare shells/REPLs exit immediately with no input (pointless). The reference implementation only warns ("Interactive terminal apps can't be driven by an agent's bash tool" + the tmux wrapper convention); bingo rejects before executing.
- **Implementation**: `tool/bash.rs::interactive_command_reason` (shared by `!` and the Bash tool) — after unwrapping sudo/env/nohup/command/exec/doas wrappers, decide by command name and arguments:
  - **Always reject**: system monitors (top/htop/btop…; `-b/--batch` snapshot mode passes), editors (vim/nano/emacs…), file managers (ranger/yazi/mc…), TUI tools (lazygit/tig/fzf/k9s/screen…), `docker/kubectl attach` and `exec/run -it`, foreground `tmux` (scripted uses like `new -d`/send-keys/capture-pane pass), gdb (`-batch` passes).
  - **Bare rejection**: shells/REPLs (bash/python/node…; with arguments they pass); DB clients (sqlite3/psql/mysql/mongosh/redis-cli — no `-c/-e/--eval` execution flags, no `<` redirect, and no SQL/script positional args means an interactive prompt; non-interactive uses like `--version`/`-l` pass).
  - **ssh**: `-t` forcing a tty, or "host only with no remote command" (password prompts/remote shells occupy `/dev/tty`) → reject; `ssh host 'cmd'` and `-N/-f` (port forwarding/background) pass. `sudo -i/-s` and bare sudo → reject.
- **Landing points**: at the top of `BashTool::call` (takes effect on the model path, fed back as `<tool_use_error>`); `run_bash_command` pre-checks **before the permission gate** (`!top` doesn't pop a pointless permission prompt; when respond is on, the model sees the rejection reason and can suggest alternatives like `top -b -n 1`) and emits a `Warning` event directly — collapsed rows can't be expanded after being flushed in inline mode, so the rejection reason must surface as a warning line. The tool description also states that interactive commands are rejected.
- **Verification**: all 187 tests pass (new: ~60 positive/negative reject/pass cases + rejection assertions on both the tool layer and the `!` path); PTY smoke: `!top` → `⚠ interactive command not allowed: top is a fullscreen interactive monitor (requires a TTY); rejected. One-off snapshots work with \`top -b -n 1\``, the command doesn't run, and it returns to the bash-mode hint.

### D21c. `!` command output preview (BashModeProgress)

- **Symptom**: after `!pwd`/`!ls` runs, the output is swallowed by the collapsed group — the collapse summary line ("Ran 1 bash command") contains no output, and once flushed in inline mode it can't be expanded, so the user can't see the command result.
- **Mechanism**: bash-mode progress = `<bash-input>` line + fullOutput via the same renderer as normal tool results — the output is shown directly under the command (long output collapses as "+N lines").
- **Implementation**: `UiHooks.on_tool_ready` and `UiEvent::ToolReady` gain `standalone: bool` — Bash activities from `!` commands are marked standalone: they only set a summary and **don't join collapse groups** (the model-driven path passes false; collapse behavior unchanged); on ToolDone, non-collapsed Bash activities are **expanded by default**, with content = output minus the `$ cmd` echo and the `[Exited with code N]` footer (`bash_output_preview`), reusing layout_activity's existing `⎿` connector-line rendering.
- **Verification**: all 189 tests pass (new: standalone collapse-decision positive/negative cases, preview expansion and stripping assertions); PTY smoke: `!pwd` → `⏺ ✓ Bash $ pwd · 8ms` + `⎿ /Users/yexrob/Episodes/Projects/bingo`; `!ls` → `⎿ AGENTS.md` + indented continuation lines, multi-line output fully visible.

### D22. AskUserQuestion tool (asking the user multiple-choice questions)

- **Contract**: `questions[1..=4]`, each `{question, header? (≤12 chars), options[2..=4] {label, description?}, multiSelect?}`; question texts and option labels are each unique. v1 implementation: `multiSelect: true` errors with guidance to use single-select; the `preview` field is not included in the schema (no preview panel in the UI); when header is missing, the title is "Question N".
- **Execution**: `src/tool/ask.rs` — `is_concurrency_safe=false` (blocks waiting for the answer; serial); each question calls `ToolContext.ask_question` (None = Esc skips, later questions are not asked); the result is `The user answered: "q"="a", ...` or `The user did not answer the questions.`; model-side input validation failures (count/uniqueness) are fed back as `tool_use_error`.
- **UI reuse**: AskUserQuestion goes through the existing permission modal (`PermissionRequest` + 1-9 keys + Esc) — `UiHooks.ask_question` shares the channel with `ask`, with `Confirm(i) → Some(i)` and `Cancel → None`. **Does not go through the permission gate** (the dialog itself is the approval; the run_query gate short-circuits by name). The tool row summary shows the question text. Subagents (Agent tool) always get None from ask_question (no UI to ask).
- **Incidental fix**: `schema_for` previously discarded the schemars generator's definitions — the schema sent to the model had dangling refs for nested types (`Vec<AskQuestion>` referenced via `$ref`). Now `generator.definitions()` are merged into the root schema (no effect on flat tools).
- **Trade-offs**: multi-select / Other free text / the preview panel are future items (multi-select components and text input need the modal protocol extended); no timeout (default never, wait indefinitely).
- **Verification**: all 196 tests pass (new: schema shape includes definitions, input validation negative cases, answer/skip/multi-select rejection, serialized execution queue, TUI Confirm/Cancel hook mapping).

### D24. MCP management: McpManager connection cache + /mcp command

- **Mechanism**: connect to all servers in parallel at startup (batch; failures don't block); connection states connected/failed/needs-auth/pending/disabled enter AppState; SSE disconnects retry with exponential backoff (5 attempts, 1s→30s); the `mcp__{server}__{tool}` prefix enters ToolRegistry, refreshed dynamically via ToolListChangedNotification; enable/disable persists the `disabledMcpServers`/`enabledMcpServers` lists (project config); `/mcp` is an immediate command = interactive UI (status badges + fork/reconnect/logs/delete menu) + `/mcp enable|disable [name|all]` + `/mcp reconnect <name>` fast path.
- **bingo's existing code reworked**: the original `connect_servers` spawned a child process per turn to reconnect (wasteful). Added **`McpManager`** (attached to `Session.runtime.mcp`): **lazy connection** (`connect_all` on the first turn, cache reused afterward), failed connections are recorded without auto-retry (`/mcp reconnect` is manual — a stdio child process exiting means total failure, so auto-reconnect is pointless), `disconnect`/`set_enabled` take effect immediately.
- **/mcp command** (argumentHint `[enable|disable [server-name]]`): no args lists servers (✓ connected · N tools / ✗ failed: details / ○ disabled / · not connected); `enable|disable [name|all]` updates the list and **persists the top-level `disabledMcpServers` in `.bingo/settings.json`** (same-named mechanism); `reconnect <name>` (when disabled, intercepts with a prompt to enable first).
- **Config contract**: `McpServerConfig` gains a `type` field (TransportSchema); **stdio** (`command`/`args`/`env`) and **http** (`url` + optional `headers`, streamable HTTP) land; sse/ws connections error with a hint (rmcp 3.1 has no legacy SSE; OAuth not done, static headers cover for now). `command` becomes optional (http has no command).
- **Permissions**: MCP tools reuse the unified permission gate (Box<dyn Tool> already provides it); is_concurrency_safe=false (serial, conservative policy).
- **Verification**: all 244 tests pass (new: McpManager state matrix, no retry on failure, reconnect clears failure + /mcp listing, enable-disable persistence, reconnect interception); tmux test (dependency-free Node stdio server): lazy connect 2 tools, badsrv failed + warning line, disable disconnects + persists across sessions, disabled reconnect interception, next turn auto-connects after enable.

### D25. Running status line (ActivityIndicator)

- **Full mechanism** (letting the user know the agent is running):
  1. **Status line (ActivityIndicator)**: one line at the bottom of the transcript, above the input box — spinner (100ms frame) + verb message (`{verb}…`) + thinking timer (`(thinking for 12s)`) + tool timer (`running tool for 3.2s`) + output token count (`↓ N tokens`) + total elapsed. Verb = running tool's activeForm/subject > thinking quip > fallback "Working". **This line is always present, whether the model is thinking, waiting, or running a tool.**
  2. **Thinking placeholder**: `⠋ Mulling for 1.4s` (~150-quip table).
  3. **Tool line**: output preview — `Running…` + elapsed when there's no output; last 5 lines + `~N lines`/`+N lines` + `(timeout 2m)` when there is.
  4. **Tool heartbeat**: 30s without output sends a progress heartbeat; long tasks keep refreshing elapsed.
  5. **Stall detection**: thresholds at 10s/45s/300s since the last token — the spinner drops intensity/switches to warning colors; on 429, shows `Waiting for API response · will retry in X · check your network`.
  6. **Spinner tips**: over 30s running hints `/btw`, over 30min hints `/clear`; when tasks exist, `Next: {subject}`.
- **bingo implementation**: `Chat::running_status()` (when busy, returns `(verb, elapsed)` — running tool summary > thinking quip > "Working"; the `turn_started` Instant is set by TurnStart/TurnEnd) + `status_row` rendered above the input box (one chrome line, visible in both inline and fullscreen; between the task area and the warning line). The verb prefers the tool summary (`$ sleep 2`), consistent with activeForm semantics.
- **Verification**: all 198 tests pass (new: `running_status` verb priority, status-line rendering assertions); PTY test with `!sleep 2`: `⠼ $ sleep 2 for 0.2s → … → 2.0s` ticking frame by frame, disappearing at turn end.
- **Leftover (an upstream iocraft issue, not introduced by this change)**: when the API hangs completely (no events at all), the tick-driven render chain starves within ~1s — the spinner/timer freeze at the moment of submission (the baseline reproduces it; probe timing can reproduce/work around it). No problem when the event stream is healthy (including real-API streaming round-trips). The status line at least shows a visible "Working" before freezing; a full fix needs changes in the iocraft render loop's wake chain (`select(root.wait(), term.wait())` has a wake race for self-driven animations). (Obsolete since the D26 rewrite.)

### D26. TUI rendering layer rewrite: iocraft → ratatui 0.30 + a hand-rolled inline driver

- **Rationale**: iocraft's inline mode redraws the whole canvas every frame (including content that never changes), pads every line with spaces to the full terminal width, its cursor-relative diff desyncs under terminal resize reflow, and a canvas ≥ terminal height triggers `Clear(All)+Purge`, wiping scrollback. The multi-round compensations (chrome bookkeeping, shrink_deficit, reflow whitelist) treated symptoms, not causes — the root of the resize staircase residue is the premise of "redrawing settled content" itself.
- **New architecture** (same as codex-rs / Claude Code): settled lines are written **once** into the terminal scrollback via the scrolling region, never redrawn; only the bottom viewport (unsettled tail + chrome) is redrawn. On resize, the terminal naturally rewraps the old content (like ordinary shell output), so residue structurally can't accumulate.
- **Layering**: `src/ui.rs` holds render-independent contracts (UiEvent/AskRequest/PermissionRequest/DialogAction/tui_hooks, zero rendering dependencies — a future GUI implements another `run_*_session` against the same contract); `tui/term.rs` is the only module in the whole crate that touches the terminal (viewport double-buffer diff + insert_history + CSI ?2026 synchronized-update wrapping, mirroring ratatui's `insert_before` scrolling-regions path and codex's `custom_terminal`); `tui/app.rs` has an explicit `select!` event loop + Frame assembly (frame height = measured row count; no second chrome formula to drift); `tui/view.rs` is pure conversion (crate `Line` → ratatui text).
- **Migration surface**: chat.rs's 4,100 lines of logic + 3,300 lines of tests survive on import changes alone (iocraft's KeyCode/KeyModifiers are already crossterm re-exports); line/theme switch the Color type; components.rs (2,122 lines) is deleted entirely; the iocraft dependency is removed, adding only ratatui (the `scrolling-regions` feature must be explicitly enabled, not default in 0.30.2; crossterm gains `event-stream`).
- **Driver semantics highlights**: while the viewport isn't bottom-pinned, `scroll_region_down` pushes it down (doesn't consume scrollback); once pinned, `scroll_region_up` moves the area above into scrollback in chunks; line tails use `Clear(UntilNewLine)` rather than padding with spaces (key to no wrap garbage on resize); emptiness is judged by full `Cell::EMPTY` equality — a space with a background color is content (the user bubble tail survives thanks to this); `HistoryItem::Raw` (kitty image bytes) is accounted per row and its lines are never cleared; viewport growth writes a real newline on the physical bottom row (the only scroll that preserves scrollback on all terminals).
- **Incidental improvements**: real bracketed-paste events (the burst heuristic drops to a fallback); real strikethrough rendering (CROSSED_OUT); the terminal's hard cursor lands on the `▋` position (D20g's intent; the iocraft no-cursor-API constraint is gone); extremely short terminals drop lines from the top to preserve the input box + footer (the old behavior triggered Purge); D25's leftover tick starvation dies with the render loop (tokio interval has no wake race).
- **Verification**: 468 tests all green (chat.rs's 115 existing tests pass with zero changes; 23 TestBackend scenario tests for the driver, including a "50-line history + narrowing resize leaves no duplicate lines" regression; 25 strategy tests ported for app/view — tail window, chrome integrity, flush not double-counting across widths, ctrl+o gating, suggestion-line counts from one source); `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` clean. Real-machine smoke tests (Ghostty long reply + drag resize, tmux+Ghostty images, Terminal.app, EL line-clearing on BCE terminals) still to be verified.
- **First round of real-terminal follow-up fixes** (2026-08-06, four items from Ghostty testing):
  1. Large blank area after a turn — the settle order was wrong: settled rows were scrolled into scrollback first (viewport still tall), then the viewport shrank, and the freed rows became a permanent blank band (height = the previous reply's row count). Changed to a driver `gap_above` bank + single-batch `frame()`: shrink first (freed rows are booked into the bank), settled rows are written straight into those rows, then the viewport is diffed — settle has zero blank area and normally zero scrolling (test asserts `scrolled_up` is empty); the unconsumed bank is reclaimed by the next growth (grow reclaims the bank before scrolling).
  2. MCP stderr punching through the TUI — now that scrollback is never redrawn, a stdio child process's logs are fixed on screen once they land (the old architecture masked this with full redraws every frame). On spawn, stderr is redirected to `~/.local/share/bingo/logs/mcp-<name>.log` (truncated and rewritten per connection; if the file can't be opened, output is dropped — never inherit the terminal).
  3. The real reason tmux images never displayed — in raw mode, every `placeholder_rows` line ends with a bare `\n`: LF only moves down without returning to column zero, so from the second line the placeholder starts at the previous line's end column, shearing the whole grid diagonally; kitty then places pixels per placeholder cell, so everything scrambles (same disease in the iocraft era — hence "never displayed"). The `kitty_image_bytes` tail advance switches to `\r\n` too.
  4. Drag-resize border ghosting — chrome's full-width lines (borders/bubbles) get reflowed/wrapped by the terminal and escape the viewport's clear area. Added a 120ms debounce: during a storm only the latest size is recorded and nothing is drawn (drawing at the old width only stacks more wrong-width lines); after silence, apply + redraw once — residue drops from one group per step to at most one group per drag (Ctrl+L can clear). The thorough fix is D27.
  Verification: 473 tests all green (driver +4: settle with zero scrolling, banked chunked scrolling, grow reclaim, resize/clear resets the bank), clippy clean.

### D27. Lazy flush + resize rehydration: the large live viewport

- **Requirement** (explicitly requested by the user): content inside the viewport must not be frozen into the terminal — everything in the window stays reflowable; when capacity grows (taller window, smaller font), even **already-flushed** content should be pulled back and re-rendered to fill the screen; "I can accept duplicates when scrolling up in that case".
- **Strategy**:
  1. **Lazy flush**: a settled segment stays in the live document as long as it still fits entirely in the visible window (terminal height − 1 − chrome), participating in diff redraws every frame (width changes reflow via `build_rows`; ctrl+o collapse still works). A segment only freezes when its start row crosses the window top, and **the whole segment freezes at once** — half-frozen would leave the hidden part neither on screen nor in scrollback, with nowhere to look; when a segment freezes wholesale, its visible tail moves from viewport drawing to scrollback, pixel-for-pixel unchanged (absorbed by the gap bank, see D26 follow-up fix 1).
  2. **Rehydrate**: after the resize debounce goes quiet, if the window capacity exceeds the live document's row count, walk back from the most recently flushed segment by checkpoints (question-answer blocks first, then message segments), trial-render via `build_rows`, and back off if the budget overflows — guarantees no settled segment sits above the window top after rehydration, so it can't fight lazy flush. Rehydration is **pure bookkeeping** (the flushed cursor rewinds; nothing is written to the terminal); old copies in scrollback physically can't be recovered — scrolling up shows a duplicate of the old geometry, a trade-off the user explicitly accepted.
- **Mechanism**: `Doc.settled_marks: Vec<SettledMark{row_end, segments, ask_rows}>` — build_rows records a checkpoint at every settlement point (welcome card / each settled message / question-answer block) (values accumulated within a build; `Chat::mark_base` digests the increments across advancing builds); the app layer's `pick_flush_mark` selects the farthest checkpoint whose segment's start row is < the window top, and `advance_flushed_upto` advances partially. The old aggregate fields `settled_segments`/`settled_ask_rows` are deleted (pure duplication of the checkpoints).
- **Side-effect analysis**: after a resize, the first frame's greatly taller viewport pushes the screen's old geometry residue into scrollback (append_lines), and the newly rendered copy then fills the screen — exactly the "accept duplicates" semantics; re-flushing a rehydrated image block re-sends the kitty transfer — U=1 updates the existing placement by id, Direct accumulates new instances without ids but old placement pixels stay put, both harmless.
- **Verification**: 476 tests all green (new: pick_flush_mark strategy matrix, no freeze when it fits, rehydration fills/backs off on budget overflow; 9 existing assertions updated to read checkpoints); clippy -D warnings clean.
- **Real-terminal follow-up fix #2 (/resume big list triggers per-line duplicates + concatenated lines)**: three compounding causes, fixed at the root —
  1. **Illegal single-line DECSTBM region** (the culprit): after lazy flush the viewport height is H−1 and `vp.top==1` is the norm; make_room emits `CSI 1;1r`+`CSI S` per line — DECSTBM requires a region of ≥2 lines, so the illegal parameter is ignored and the region falls back to the **full screen**: every written line scrolls the full screen, interleaving viewport content and writes as they move up → adjacent per-line duplicates + concatenated tails of new lines covering old ones (TestBackend is semantically correct for single-line regions, hence all 27 driver tests green while real hardware fails). Fix: the viewport cap uniformly becomes **H−2** (driver clamp / Frame budget / tail_window, three same-source places), so `vp.top ≥ 2` always holds and the region is always legal.
  2. **`CSI S` doesn't enter scrollback** (explicit kitty/Ghostty semantics: SU-scrolled lines go into a bit bucket): flush scrolling switches to the codex-style primitive — `RawWrite::scroll_into_scrollback`: DECSTBM top-anchored region + cursor parked at the region's bottom row + n LFs + reset (LF is the only scroll that enters scrollback on all terminals); the test-side Recorder maps it back to `scroll_region_up` to keep TestBackend semantically equivalent — all 27 driver tests untouched.
  3. **Transient slash output evicting live content** (policy error): /resume's no-arg list is a TTL transient line at the document tail that squeezes the window and wrongly freezes live conversation (and 2s later the window is half empty). `Doc.transient_rows` marks the transient row count; the lazy-flush window computation excludes them — temporary lists merely cover, they don't evict.
  Verification: 477 tests all green (new: transient-no-freeze regression test; 3 H−1 expectations change with the cap to H−2), clippy clean.
- **Real-terminal follow-up fix #3 (after resize the viewport jumps to the bottom, piling old frames into a multi-width residue stack)**: `term.resize()` unconditionally re-anchored the viewport to the screen bottom — when content didn't fill the screen (e.g. only the welcome card at the top), every width drag flung the viewport to the bottom and redrew, leaving the old-position frame above forever uncleared: one drag piles up a stack of cards at different widths. Changed to **content anchoring** (CC's behavior, named by the user): resize keeps the viewport on its original rows and only moves it up enough to fit when the new screen can't hold it; clearing goes from the viewport's original position to the screen end, wiping the terminal-reflow fragments pushed out of the old viewport. The viewport renders from the content start, consistent with a freshly started session. 477 tests green (`resize_taller_keeps_the_viewport_content_anchored` replaces the old jump-to-bottom assertion).
- **Real-terminal follow-up fix #4 (one row of wrap fragments still remains above the viewport origin after narrowing)**: when the width shrinks, terminal reflow happens before the resize event; old full-width lines wrap and push content down as a whole, and if it hits the screen bottom the whole screen scrolls up — the shift between our recorded viewport origin and physical reality is **protocol-unknowable**, so "clear downward from the origin" inevitably misses fragments pushed above the origin. The ultimate strategy is to stop guessing geometry: after the resize debounce, go through the Ctrl+L channel (`force_redraw` → `clear_visible`) to clear the whole visible screen and redraw the window from the top at the new width; rehydration has already pulled content back to fill the screen, so the picture is lossless and old-geometry copies stay only in scrollback (a trade-off the user accepts). From here on, on-screen behavior after resize is fully deterministic, independent of any terminal reflow behavior.
- **Real-terminal follow-up fix #5 (full-screen misalignment ghosting after Ctrl+C + MCP stderr still punching through)**: two independent causes —
  1. **Reclaim growth clears the diff buffer** (the ghosting culprit): at turn end the status line disappears → the viewport shrinks by 1 (bottom-anchored, origin moves down, top line cleared into the bank); the Ctrl+C notice line appears → growth takes the reclaim path, which cleared both buffers to "force a full redraw" — but physically only the banked rows are blank; the rest is still the old frame. With prev lying about being fully empty, the diff believes the screen is empty: the new frame's **empty lines don't clear old text underneath** (`❯ Hi`/reply adjacent duplicates, card bottom-border fragments surviving) and **shorter lines don't clear their tails** (input-box border `────` residue to the right of the notice text). Fix: reclaim no longer clears the buffers; `retarget_buffers` gains a signed offset (shrink +shift bottom-anchored, downward expansion/scrolled growth 0 top-anchored, reclaim growth −reclaimed bottom-anchored with blank rows added on top — exactly mirroring the physically blank banked rows), so **prev truthfully mirrors the physical screen at all times** becomes a driver invariant (resize/clear_visible clear the buffers only because they physically clear the screen; the law holds). The regression test `grow_after_shrink_repaints_over_every_stale_row` precisely reproduces the screenshot artifact under the old implementation (`["eeee","bbbb","ffff","ggdd"]`). The trigger surface is broader than Ctrl+C: any "shrink → grow" sequence (send a message / open help / surface a suggestion after every turn end) hits it.
  2. **The rmcp builder overrides stderr** (the redirect from follow-up fix #1 never took effect): rmcp 3.1.0's `TokioChildProcess::new` internally goes through a builder whose default is `stderr: Stdio::inherit()`, and its `spawn()` unconditionally calls `.stderr(self.stderr)`, **overriding** the value already set on the Command — our log-file sink set on the Command is silently discarded. Fix: go explicitly through `TokioChildProcess::builder(command).stderr(stderr_sink(name)).spawn()`. The timing matches "stably appears after sending a message": MCP lazy-connects when assemble_tools spawns on the first message, so the banner lands exactly at the cursor (input box).
  Verification: 478 tests all green, clippy clean.
- **inline ctrl+o = expand/collapse toggle; expansion replays the entire transcript** (CC's non-fullscreen ctrl+o, named by the user): write-once scrollback means "expand in place" doesn't exist inline — the old scheme only allowed toggling collapse on the last unsettled message (the `last_message_dynamic` gate) and left flushed content alone. Switched to CC semantics, both directions:
  - **Expand** (collapsible items or flushed content exist): `Chat::expand_transcript` expands **all** collapsible items in the full history (activities + collapse groups), `reset_flushed` rewinds the flush cursor, sets `dump_transcript` + `force_redraw`; the app layer **clears the visible screen first** during replay (same as resize — without the clear, the relative position of the old frame and the replayed lines depends on viewport history, and short content would duplicate on the same screen), then rebuilds the whole document from the welcome card, takes the **last** settlement checkpoint, and freezes the whole volume into scrollback with one `flush_items` + `advance_flushed_upto`: replayed content lays out from the top of the screen with chrome right below, anything beyond the screen rolls naturally into scrollback, and the user scrolls up to see it all. The dynamic tail (streaming messages/permission dialogs/transient slash lines, all outside checkpoints) stays in the viewport as usual. No-op when the whole picture is on screen with nothing expandable.
  - **Collapse** (`transcript_fully_expanded`: collapsible items exist and all are expanded): `Chat::collapse_transcript` folds the full history back into aggregates, then takes the **same shrink path as resize** — undo the unrendered replay, `force_redraw` clears the visible screen, `rehydrate` refills the window at the collapsed height. The expanded replay lines on screen stay only in scrollback (write-once; without a clear they'd coexist on screen with the collapsed window). The predicate is always false when nothing is collapsible, so ctrl+o degrades to pure replay.
  Collapsed old copies stay above in scrollback — duplicates accepted (same trade-off as rehydration). Zero new driver primitives: a combination of rewind (same as /clear, /resume) + full freeze (same as lazy flush) + clear-and-rehydrate (same as resize). The `last_message_dynamic` gate is deleted; fullscreen ctrl+o remains an in-place collapse toggle (it can redraw there). 478 tests all green (2 gate tests rewritten as replay/collapse semantics).

### D28. Activity-row icon vocabulary: shape encodes category, color encodes state

- **Problem** (the user said "too ugly"): every activity row shows the same `⏺`, MCP tools expose their full raw name `mcp__server__tool(...)`, and Skills fall back to k=v `args="doc.md"` — categories indistinguishable, noisy.
- **Vocabulary**: `⏺` built-in tools (the CC anchor stays; group rows/reply dots/Update are the same family) · `◆` MCP (external components; display name `server:tool`, permission rules still use the full `mcp__` name) · `✦` Skill (same family as the ✢✻✽ starburst spinners; summary becomes `skill name args`) · `◉` subagent Watch line (a core within a ring = session within session; Agent is a hidden tool whose only visible line is the watch). Colors still encode state only (dim running/green success/red failure) — one role, one color.
- **Implementation**: `activities.rs tool_glyph`/`display_tool_name` + the `watch_header` label-prefix decision; `summarize_input` gains a Skill arm. All display-layer, zero behavior change. All four glyphs are unicode_width single-width (◆/◉ are EA=Ambiguous, same class as the existing ○/◇, already accepted). 480 tests green. (The label-prefix decision moves to a WatchKind contract field with D29.)

### D29. Named agents + instance continuation (first cut: hub-and-spoke)

Three rounds of design discussion (the user deleted concepts round by round) converged on the multi-agent roadmap: this entry is step one (non-experimental); step two is channel messaging (experimental flag, design frozen below).

- **Named definitions** (`src/agents.rs`): `~/.config/bingo/agents/*.md` + `.bingo/agents/*.md` flat files (the project layer near cwd overrides the user layer with the same name); frontmatter `name/description/model/provider/thinking`, body = the subagent's system prompt (replaces the parent system; empty inherits); precedence: explicit args > definition > inheritance (model/provider/thinking independent of each other; thinking inherits a snapshot of the parent session's current level). Frontmatter parsing is generalized into `skills::parse_frontmatter_pairs` (arbitrary keys + folded/literal scalars), shared by skills and agent definitions. Definitions number in single digits; no mtime caching.
- **Instance registry** (`AgentRegistry`, shared at Session level): every Agent spawn registers a named instance (`name` arg defaults to the definition name/agent; name collisions auto-suffix -2/-3), state machine Running/Idle/Stopped. On turn completion, **the full message history returned by run_query** is stored in the entry — continuation = old history + new instructions back into run_query, zero context loss.
- **Continuation and lifecycle** (only assembled at depth==0; hub-and-spoke): `SendMessage(agent, message)` queues while busy (the same background task chain auto-runs the next turn when the current one ends), wakes with history while idle (new spawn); `AgentControl(list|stop|delete)` lists/stops (aborts the current turn + sets the watch line to Cancelled, history kept)/deletes (removes the entry, name released). Multiple queued instructions are combined into one prompt in order. Subagents can still spawn further (depth cap 3) but don't manage siblings.
- **Display**: `WatchKind` threads through Watchable → WatchEvent → UiEvent → WatchCall (a contract field replacing D28's label-prefix decision); subagent watch lines show `◉ name · task`, continued turns `◉ name #N · instruction summary` (one line per turn; label unique so the TUI doesn't collide rows by label).
- **Leftover**: a synchronous (background:false) subagent whose whole turn is interrupted by the user may stay in Running (no driver) — AgentControl stop/delete can clean it up; same class as the old orphaned watch rows; no new failure surface added.
- **Step two (channel messaging, experimental flag `experimental.agentChannels`) is implemented**: design principles — capabilities universal (everyone can listen and speak), choice autonomous (silence is an agent's decision after waking; not calling Post is silence, zero cost, no wake propagation); the engine has zero game/scenario knowledge; discipline like addressing lives entirely in prompts. Implementation:
  1. **`src/channels.rs` (pure state)**: a channel = member list + serial|free + monotonic seq + full log + per-member seen cursor + message counts; `post()` does exactly three things — stamp (from is taken by the caller from `Session.instance`; the model can't forge it), serial staleness check (seen < seq → `Stale{missed}` bounced back with the delta marked as read), budget gate (50 per agent per channel / 500 per channel; over-limit freezes + one hub_mail warning). The hub member is always named `main` (`claim_name` reserved).
  2. **Delivery wake-up (orchestrated at the tool layer)**: the `AgentRegistry` mailbox generalizes into `InboxItem::Direct|Channel`, one lock for atomic "deposit + claim" so no wake is lost; the Sent branch of Post `deposit`s to every member — Idle immediately `spawn_agent_loop`s (with `absorb_inbox` formatting `[#channel #N] sender: content` and advancing the seen cursor), Running accumulates in the mailbox for batch injection at turn boundaries, Stopped silently drops. The hub goes through `hub_mail`: before each reasoning round in the query loop, `<channel-messages>` is injected; when the TUI is idle, a `◇` row's WatchEvent triggers submit_auto (with a TurnEnd check as fallback).
  3. **A serial bounce is a tool result, not an error**: `Post` returns "not sent + delta + please re-decide"; within the same turn's tool loop the model reads the delta and decides on its own to send as-is / modify / abandon — count-based ordering emerges from competition + retry (every contested round lands exactly one, convergence guaranteed).
  4. **Tool surface**: the hub (depth 0 and flag on) gets `Channel` (create/invite/kick/list; members limited to direct subagents at depth==1; late joiners get no backlog, seen set to the current head) + `Post`; cohort members (depth 1 with an instance name) only get `Post`; deeper levels and the flag-off state assemble neither. AgentControl delete also clears the member out of all channels.
  5. **Watching**: one `◇ #name` watch line per channel (WatchKind::Channel); post updates detail (N messages · latest speaker) and payload (last 50 log lines; ctrl+o expands to see the whole chat); Running-state updates don't produce notification noise.
  6. **v1 has no engine-side waiting**: round_robin/gather were both deleted in discussion (ordering = scheduling/protocol, not transport), so no timeout mechanism is needed; the budget is the only stop-loss. settings merge per field (any layer's flag on ⇒ on).

### D30. Entity view: bottom selector + alternate-screen modals (agent conversations / WeChat-style channel rooms)

- **Requirement** (named by the user, modeled on CC's multi-agent display): agents are shown at the bottom; ↑↓ selects, Enter opens that agent's conversation; channels are in the list too, opening forced-fullscreen with a WeChat-style layout (others left-aligned, mine right-aligned).
- **Selector** (`chat.rs`): a bottom entity area (chrome, above the input box) — collapsed state is a one-line dim summary (`◉ scout(running) · ◇ #table(3) — ctrl+g to view`); after ctrl+g focus, per-line `❯` selection (window scrolls, cap 6 lines), Enter sets `open_entity`, Esc collapses; the snapshot refreshes via `refresh_entities` on tick (every 15 ticks) and on WatchEvent, and only dirties when content changes. Selector keys take precedence over the global Esc semantics.
- **Modals** (`src/tui/entity.rs`): write-once scrollback means inline has no "swap content in place" — both views run on the **alternate screen** (a fullscreen host already on the alternate screen doesn't nest in/out). Self-drawn loop (ratatui Terminal paints the full frame each time), bottom-pinned scrolling + ↑↓ offset, Esc/ctrl+c returns; during a modal, `chat.tick + drain_all` continue as usual (background agent events aren't lost; the hub's auto turns still get pulled up). **Return takes a deterministic redraw**: inline sets pending_resize (the existing resize pipeline of clear + rehydrate + force_redraw, not betting on the alternate screen's restore fidelity), fullscreen sets force_redraw.
- **Agent conversation view**: registry history (❯ instructions subtle / body plain text wrapped / `⏺ tool(summary)` dim; tool_result and thinking stay out of the view) + **streaming live tail** — `AgentRegistry.live` holds an output Arc shared per turn with subagent_hooks (attached at turn start, detached at end), so opening while running shows the text being generated + `✻ generating…`.
- **Channel room**: `user` becomes a third reserved member (auto-seated like main, immovable, budget-exempt, `claim_name` reserved); bubble layout — others left (name tag + code_block_bg, consecutive same-sender merges the name tag), user right (user_message_bg, right-aligned padding; SegStyle per-segment backgrounds, not a whole-row Row.bg); the bottom input line's Enter speaks as user via `deliver_post` (the same delivery/wake path as the Post tool); **rendering = read** (mark_seen to the log tail every frame, so the person on screen is always current against serial checks and never bounces back).
- 506 tests green (bubble layout/agent view/selector state-machine pure-function tests; the modal loop and host wiring are thin coverage, same layer as fullscreen).

### D31. agent team: project-scoped roster + cross-session memory (key = project path + branch)

Requirement (named by the user): ① teams are fixed to a project (committable), and the project reads and starts them by default at launch; ② teams keep memory, bound to "current project path + current branch". Two full brainstorming rounds in `#dev-room` converged (dev-ex/ui-ux/dev/qa, 28 entries).

- **Mental model**: the team is the blueprint (persistent definition), the room is the construction site (volatile runtime state). team = a declarative roster layer reusing every existing primitive, returning to the hub-and-spoke control plane when done.
- **Config** `.bingo/team.json` (camelCase, committed, same layer as settings.json): `name` + `channel{ mode: serial|free, messageLimit: positive integer }` + `members[{ name, agent }]`. Members reference AgentDefs rather than inlining personas — the single source of truth for personas stays in `.bingo/agents/<name>.md`, and one persona can join multiple teams. Separation of concerns: settings governs "whether to start" (`team.autoStart`), the team file governs "what to start".
- **Default load at startup**: `autoStart` defaults true (the user's literal "read by default"), with two opt-outs: settings off + `--no-team` CLI. **Starting ≠ waking**: only spawn members + create the room, going to the existing Idle standby (zero tokens, zero turns); it only runs when SendMessage/channel messages arrive; acceptance asserts "token=0, no turn logs before a task arrives". Startup completes with a one-line notice `[team] dev-room ready · 3/3 standing by (/team status · /team stop)`, escalating to a warning on anomalies.
- **Implemented as three thin layers, no new runtime**: team.json parsing (the validate function shares its source with start: if validate passes, start must succeed) → `spawn_team` orchestration (existing Agent spawn + `ChannelRegistry` create-if-not-exists + member dedup) → the `/team` command family. Idempotency key = instance name: repeated start reuses (wording `spawned ×3` vs `reused ×3`, same `[team]` prefix, different verb).
- **One command line**: `/team list` (definition area / runtime area, two screens) → `start` → `status` (standing by/busy/anomaly/offline, four states, color+char dual encoding ●green ◐yellow ✗red ○gray) → `assign` (= SendMessage) → `stop`; `/team new` interactive scaffolding (output must pass validate; unreachable AgentDefs are intercepted immediately when picking members) → `/team validate`.
- **AgentDef gains `source: AgentDefSource`** (Project/User/Unknown): `load_agent_defs` records the first origin at load time (project layer loads first, first-wins dedup → same-name cross-layer overrides mark source=Project); legacy data without a source defaults to `Unknown` without error, and the UI silently omits the badge. AgentDef has no serialization path today, so adding a field is zero-break.
- **Edge cases (finalized by qa)**: missing AgentDef reports a three-part message "missing name + lookup paths + field path"; duplicate member names in config = reject; empty members = config error, single member is legal; member-level failure isolation (keep starting the rest; failed ones are marked anomalous and can be re-spawned individually); half-started states stay recognizable (`partially started · 2/3`), no auto-rollback; three-layer settings merging gets autoStart override-order tests; unknown fields are ignored (backward compatibility).
- **Memory persistence** (second convergence round):
  - **Key = project path (project_hash) + branch**: worktree scenarios work naturally (the main repo's main and `.bingo/worktrees/agent-team` differ in both path and branch, so memories never cross-pollute); absolute paths are avoided; a project_hash validation assertion prevents a copy from mounting on the wrong machine.
  - **Content layering**: full history on disk (fidelity on restore) + decision records (append-only, zero model cost; the `sources` pipe-separated field reuses `parse_frontmatter_pairs`; `type` drops to entry level).
  - **Storage**: user layer, per project+branch directories (not committed by default); collaborative export via `export` with zero transformation (frontmatter is the schema fields); `project_hash` included in the export file header.
  - **Fragment cleanup**: the `/team memory list|show|gc|merge|export` command family; gc has a TTL; corrupted/orphaned files use the same visual language as config errors (no new styles).
  - **Restore timing**: auto-restore on startup launch, one unobtrusive summary line; restore and launch both go through spawn_team; missing files silently fall back to empty history.
- **Acceptance assertion chain**: scaffold output → validate passes → start doesn't fail on config; memory roundtrip (save → restart → restore equivalent); source cross-layer override; behavior fully unchanged for old projects without a team section.
